# Upgrading BOSH - Overview

There are several tutorials for upgrading/updating a running BOSH.

* Upgrade an AWS microbosh using a new AMI [no new AMIs have been released yet]
* [Upgrade a microbosh using a new stemcell](upgrading-microbosh-from-stemcell.md)
* Upgrade a pure bosh from bosh-release

Each tutorial above assumes that you are also updating your local bosh CLI/gems:

* [Update bosh CLI from source](upgrading-bosh-cli-from-source.md)
* Update bosh CLI from gems
