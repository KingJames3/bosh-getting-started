# Not using fog?

These tutorials assume you are using fog to provision infrastructure outside of BOSH.

If you're not using fog, here are a selection of public AMIs to use that are [used by the fog](https://github.com/fog/fog/blob/master/lib/fog/aws/models/compute/server.rb#L55-66) example above:

```ruby
when 'ap-northeast-1'
  'ami-5e0fa45f'
when 'ap-southeast-1'
  'ami-f092eca2'
when 'eu-west-1'
  'ami-3d1f2b49'
when 'us-east-1'
  'ami-3202f25b'
when 'us-west-1'
  'ami-f5bfefb0'
when 'us-west-2'
  'ami-e0ec60d0'
```
