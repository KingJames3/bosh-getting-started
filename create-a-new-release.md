# Create a new release

You can quickly create the initial scaffold for a new release using the 3rd-party `bosh-gen` tool (ok, to be fair, Dr Nic wrote it).

Install the tool using RubyGems:

```
gem install bosh-gen
```

```
~/.bosh_deployments/redis-on-demand
bosh-gen new redis-on-demand
cd redis-on-demand
```

This will generate the scaffold for the release in a folder `~/.bosh_deployments/redis-on-demand/redis-on-demand`. Later we will put the one or more deployment manifest files in the parent folder `~/.bosh_deployments/redis-on-demand`.

The generated project will also be converted into a Git repository. If you don't want this, then delete the `~/.bosh_deployments/redis-on-demand/redis-on-demand/.git` folder .

## Packages built from original source

```
$ bosh-gen package redis
      create  packages/redis/packaging
      create  packages/redis/pre_packaging
      create  packages/redis/spec
```

The initial `spec` manifest shows below that this package requires no files and has no dependencies on any other packages.

```yml
$ cat packages/redis/spec
---
name: redis
dependencies: []
files: []
```

If we were to attempt to create a release now, we'll see that BOSH requires that packages all require one or more source files.

```
$ bosh create release
...

Building packages
-----------------
Error 500: Package 'redis' doesn't include any files
```

Let's add some redis source code to the redis package! (link comes from [redis downloads page](http://redis.io/download "Download â€“ Redis"))

```
$ bosh-gen source redis http://redis.googlecode.com/files/redis-2.4.13.tar.gz
Downloading http://redis.googlecode.com/files/redis-2.4.13.tar.gz...
...
       force  packages/redis/spec
      create  src/redis/redis-2.4.13.tar.gz
```

The redis package spec is now updated to reference the source tarball.

```yaml
$ cat packages/redis/spec
---
name: redis
dependencies: []
files:
- redis/redis-2.4.13.tar.gz
```

We now have a valid release (albeit, without any jobs that will require our redis package)

```
$ bosh create release --force
...

## Packaging a package source

Packages are compiled on demand during the deployment. This process is completely automated by BOSH. How it works and how compilation is triggered will be discussed later. In this section, we need to tell BOSH how to compile the redis source code into binary executables. These compiled executables will be automatically available during deployment on all VMs that need it. 

Each package has two executable hooks that are run during the package compilation process

* `pre_packaging` - run when the source of the package is assembled during the `bosh create release` (in developer environment)
* `packaging` - compilation process run during deployment (in a clean stemcell VM)

For the redis package, only the `packaging` script is necessary. Copy the following into `packages/redis/packaging`. If you are using a more modern redis download, then replace `2.4.13` below with your version number.

```bash
tar zxf redis/redis-2.4.13.tar.gz

if [[ $? != 0 ]] ; then
  echo "Failed extracting redis"
  exit 1
fi

(
  cd redis-2.4.13
  make
  make PREFIX=$BOSH_INSTALL_TARGET install
)
```

Note `PREFIX=$BOSH_INSTALL_TARGET` above. All `packaging` scripts must place their compiled outputs in a specific folder that BOSH determines. This folder location is provided by the `$BOSH_INSTALL_TARGET` environment variable. Only the contents of this folder are used as the "compiled package", and only the contents of this folder will be installed into the VMs during deployment.

This is different from many other packaging systems which assume that they can install files anywhere on the file system. In BOSH, packages can only manage files within a specific subfolder. This ensures clean separation of all packages and all versions of the same package.

At this time in the tutorial, it is not yet possible to test our packaging scripts in isolation. Package compilation is performed automatically during deployment. Deployment of a package requires a deployment manifest and one or more jobs that use the package. 

Let's wire up the redis job and a simple deployment manifest now.

## Starting processes or jobs

We can now install redis, but we cannot yet run redis (specifically we care about `redis-server`). How to start or stop a process is described by a job. In fact, packages are only installed on VMs during deployment if they are required directly or indirectly by the job assigned to that VM.

To create a redis job that requires the redis package:

```
$ bosh-gen job redis -d redis
      create  jobs/redis
      create  jobs/redis/monit
      create  jobs/redis/templates/redis_ctl
      create  jobs/redis/spec
```

Jobs each have a spec file of their dependencies and of templates/files that they want to be created during deployment.

```yml
$ cat jobs/redis/spec 
---
name: redis
packages:
- redis
templates:
  redis_ctl: redis_ctl
```

We need to update the initial `redis_ctl` script to tell the job how to start the `redis-server` command.

Replace:

```bash
exec /var/vcap/packages/redis/bin/EXECUTABLE_SERVER
```

with

```bash
exec /var/vcap/packages/redis/bin/redis-server
```

It happens that `redis-server` can take configuration via its first argument. We will set up the configuration and pass properties from the deployment manifest later. For the moment, we will run redis using all its defaults.

The control script `reds_ctl` also determines where STDOUT and STDERR from the redis job will go. From the template, we will be able to find the log files at `/var/vcap/sys/log/redis` on any redis job VM.
