# Creating a new stemcell

If you are on a new IaaS and/or if there isn't a public stemcell for your architecture (at the time of writing the only non-vSphere public stemcell, is `bosh-stemcell-aws-0.6.2.tgz` which is for 64-bit AWS), then you will need to create a base stemcell for your environment VMs.

If you want your environment VMs to boot faster - by not having to install packages - you can also create a custom stemcell that includes all the packages you need.

## Creating a stemcell

**TODO - write this tutorial**

Boot up a big 64-bit VM. You only use 64-bit AWS instances now, right?

SSH into your MicroBOSH Ubuntu instance.

```
sudo su -
apt-get install debootstrap

```

You'll need ovftool from VMWare. Go here http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/ovf/, agree to the agreement. Then:

* Click "Use Web Browser" checkbox
* Then get the URL for the .bundle file for Linux 64-bit
* Download it to your VM

```
